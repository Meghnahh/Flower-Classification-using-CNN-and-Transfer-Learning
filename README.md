# Flower-Classification-using-CNN-and-Transfer-Learning

Downloading the flower photos manually and building the pandas dataset. Then, built a batch generator and a base CNN model. Implementing the keras.preprocessing.ImageGenerator to apply multiple transformation of images and then building CNN model again with batch generator. Finally, incorporating transfer learning and loading the pre-trained model with the ResNet50 arhcitecture to attain the accuracy of 91.48%
